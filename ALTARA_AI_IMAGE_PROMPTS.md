## Usage Guidelines for AI Image Generation

### Resolution Specifications
- **Hero images** (homepage, key pages): 1920×1080px minimum, 2560×1440px preferred
- **Content images** (page sections): 1200×800px minimum
- **Thumbnail images** (cards, grids): 600×400px minimum
- **Mobile hero**: 1080×1920px (vertical orientation for mobile-first)

### Aspect Ratios
- **Wide establishing shots**: 16:9 or 3:2
- **Product close-ups**: 4:3 or 1:1
- **Mobile app mockups**: 9:16 (vertical)
- **Signage documentation**: 4:3 or 3:2

### Color Accuracy
When generating images, emphasize these color relationships:
- Teal (`#0891B2`) should appear as modern aqua-cyan, not navy blue or turquoise
- Orange (`#F97316`) should appear as vivid energetic orange, not red-orange or coral
- Lighting should preserve color accuracy without heavy color grading
- White elements should be clean white, not cream or off-white
- Gray elements should be cool neutral gray, not warm gray

### Consistency Across Images
- Maintain consistent teal shade across all images (some generators shift hues)
- Orange LED accents should have consistent brightness and color temperature
- Canopy designs should be consistent (same teal color, similar structural elements)
- Charging cabinets should have consistent design language and branding application
- Modern professional aesthetic should be maintained across all contexts

### Post-Processing Notes
- May need to color-correct generated images to match exact brand colors
- Ensure teal (#0891B2) and orange (#F97316) are accurate to hex values
- Remove any unintended brand logos or text (especially on vehicles)
- Clean up any artifacts or inconsistencies in architectural rendering
- Ensure signage text is legible and matches Outfit font style
